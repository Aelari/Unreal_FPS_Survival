# Unreal_FPS_Survival
 My adaptation to a game tutorial on Game Dev.tv

Run the EXE to play the game.
There is no reload, ammo drops are on the map and enemies will drop a random amount on death.
Health pick-ups are available in three locations.
Enemies are endless, survive as long as you can.
There is no method to restart the game from inside the app, I am working on that.

This is still very much in development, don't expect everything to work perfectly.

===== Planned Changes ===== 
Health drops from boss mobs every 50 kills.
Ammo only comes from killed enemies.
Game menu and game over screens.
Difficulty scaling as game progresses.
